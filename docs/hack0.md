# Hack0 - What the hack?

I maintain [LADXR](https://daid.github.io/LADXR/). And every month, I hold a "special" kind of "race" within this randomizer.

It's just a for fun thing. Where I try out new things, new settings, or things that are not really something that can integrate well into the main randomizer, but still fun to try once.

Just to list things that we've done in these hacks:
* Money = life. You start with 300 rupees, every second, one rupees is subtraced. If you have zero rupees left, you die. Instead normal damage, damage goes to rupees as well.
* Easter egg hunt. Seashells where replaced with eggs. And you needed 20 eggs to open the windfish egg. This was introduced as a normal setting for "seashell hunt goal" after this.
* Fish-da-pond. Silly hack where you had to fish the fishing minigame empty to win.
* jenglish. All texts where pulled trough google translated to japanese, and then back to english.
* SuperHot. The game only advances while you hold a button.
* Superweapons, all items got really strong, you can put down tons of bombs, shoot arrows fast, etc. People enjoyed this so much that is became a setting.
* Bossrush, before the nightmare boss you first got to fight every other boss.
* Wrecking ball, you always have the D7 wrecking ball with you.

Not all of these work out great. But that's kinda the idea, just to try things. Sometimes is fun, sometimes it wack, sometimes it becomes a new setting.

One thing is sure. Each and every one of these is a huge **hack**.

And that brings us to the story of today...

# Final Fantasy Adventure.

As a side project, I've been reverse engineering the gameboy game Final Fantasy Adventure. You can read all about that at https://daid.github.io/FFA-Disassembly/

Now. I had the crazy idea. [Super Metroid + A link to the past](https://samus.link/) randomizer is a thing. Which combines two super nintendo games into one. Could I do the same for Links Awakening?
